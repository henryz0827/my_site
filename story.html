      <div class="prose reveal">
        <p>People sometimes ask me how a math major ends up building enterprise AI. The honest answer is: I didn't plan any of it. I just kept following whatever I found most interesting, and it kept leading me to the same kind of problem — messy, real-world, nobody-has-a-clean-answer-yet problems. Here's how it happened.</p>

        <p>I remember sitting in my first stochastic calculus lecture thinking "I have no idea what I'll use this for." Three years later I was using it to price volatility surfaces at Morgan Stanley. That kept happening at Stanford — I'd learn something that felt purely abstract, and then it would turn out to be exactly the thing I needed for a real problem I hadn't encountered yet.</p>
        <p>Convex optimization became the backbone of my portfolio construction code. The machine learning class gave me the confidence to say "I can build that" when someone described a prediction problem. A distributed systems course taught me that being correct is much harder than being clever — a lesson that saved me a lot of pain later.</p>
        <p>I picked math as a major because I couldn't decide what to do with my life. Everyone around me seemed to know — CS, pre-med, consulting. I just liked solving problems and figured the rest would sort itself out. Looking back, it was the best decision I accidentally made.</p>

        <h3 class="story-marker"><span class="story-date">Summer 2023 · Morgan Stanley, New York</span>My first day with real data</h3>
        <p>I still remember the morning I opened my first TAQ dataset. I'd spent years working with clean academic data — CSVs with nice headers, maybe a few missing values. This was different. Millions of rows per day, timestamps down to the microsecond, and every row was a tiny decision someone made with real money. I sat there for an hour just scrolling through it, trying to understand the rhythm.</p>
        <p>The work itself was equity stock-selection — ranking thousands of stocks by predicted alpha using IC/IR-ranked signals with cross-sectional scoring. I improved simulated returns by <strong>15% over the existing production model</strong>, which was the headline number. But the microstructure work was what actually changed how I think.</p>
        <p>I built pipelines for queue imbalance, adverse selection metrics, fill probability, and a GRU-based volatility forecaster fusing order book data with HMM-tagged regime indicators. The vol model cut out-of-sample MAE by 8% on stressed weeks.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="pullquote reveal">That summer I learned something I keep coming back to: most of what looks like a pattern in data is just noise wearing a disguise. The real skill isn't finding patterns — any model can do that. It's knowing which ones will still be there tomorrow.</div>

        <h3 class="story-marker"><span class="story-date">Sep 2024 — Present · Lenovo</span>Making AI do real work</h3>
        <p>After Morgan Stanley I knew what I wanted next: not just models, but <em>systems</em>. I wanted to build something that a non-technical person could use on a Tuesday afternoon to make a better decision than they would have made without it. That's how I ended up leading a team of 5 at Lenovo, building <strong>iChain</strong>.</p>
        <p>iChain is Lenovo's enterprise human-AI platform — 200+ production agents across 10+ business units. A supply chain manager in Shenzhen uses an agent I built to decide whether to reroute a shipment. A demand planner in Raleigh uses another one to adjust forecasts. The system has to be right, fast, and cheap. There's no room for a model that works great in a notebook but falls apart in production.</p>
        <p>The part I'm proudest of is the orchestration engine I built on LangGraph. Routing, parallel tool execution, batching, concurrency controls — the kind of infrastructure that makes the difference between a demo and a product. We cut error rate by 17%, inference cost by 32%, and p95 latency by 41%.</p>
        <p>I also trained a domain-adapted 7B model via QLoRA as our automated quality scorer. It beat GPT-4 on our internal eval by 12% F1, which tells you something about the value of domain-specific data over raw model size.</p>
